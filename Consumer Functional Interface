Consumer<T> is used when we have to provide some input parameter, perform certain operation, but donâ€™t need to return anything. Moreover, we can use Consumer to consume object
and perform certain operation. (https://javatechonline.com/predefined-functional-interfaces/#ConsumerltTgt)


interface Consumer<T> {
   void accept(T t);
}

=> T denotes the input parameter type.
In Java 1.8 APi , there is a method called forEach() always accept the consumer FI.
