Supplier<R> doesnâ€™t take any input and it always returns some object. However, we use it when we need to get some value based on some operation like supply Random numbers, 
supply Random OTPs, supply Random Passwords etc. For example, below code denotes it :

interface Supplier<R>{
    R get();
}

=> R is a return type
